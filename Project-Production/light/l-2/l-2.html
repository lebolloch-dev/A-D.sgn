          <b> Lumen </b>is a living light that grows and evolves. And thanks to
          a <b> bioluminescent organism </b> that can positively influence our
          daily lives.
        </p>
        <p class="delay2">
          This bioluminescent organism is a fungus,
          <b> pannellus stipticus </b>. He needs moisture and dead wood to feed
          himself. The cultivation of this fungus is therefore within the reach
          of all.

          It allows, at the same time, to reduce, in terms, the overconsumption
          of electricity, at times when the main light of the habitat is
          dispensable.But also to have an impact on our brain activity thanks to
          its <b>luminotherapeutic property</b>.It has been observed that the
          green - blue light spectrum stimulates the cognitive functions of the
          brain: memory, attention, visio - spatial functions, ...

          This light has been designed to be placed on the ground without any
          risk of rolling, thanks to a flat shape present on the end of the body
          in ABS, or hung from the ceiling, thanks to a fabric tie concealed in
          the ABS body.

          The design of this culture box, both contemporary and minimalist,
          reminding us of a light bulb, was designed to make the link with the
          function of this object: <b>to illuminate</b>.
